// Problem Solving

// 1 STEP

// 1. Can I restate the problem with my own words?
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In the other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// 2 STEP

// 1. Seach more details of the problema
// 2. Break the problem in little pieces
// 3. Create a pseudo-code with the principal tasks to solving the problem

// 3 STEP

// 1. Implementing the code
// If you stuck on a step, jump to other little tasks

// 4 STEP

// Reviewing the solution
// Try refactoring the code
